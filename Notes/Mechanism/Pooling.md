Overlapped Pooling

[Max Pooling is a downsampling strategy in Convolutional Neural Networks | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-forum/60325)

In almost all of the famous CNN architectures, max pooling has been performed with overlapping regions. [Kernel Size, Stride] -

```txt
AlexNet = [3x3, 2];
GoogleNet = [3x3, 2] , [3x3, 1];
VGGCNNS = [3x3,3], [2x2,2];
VGGCNNM and variants = [3x3, 2];
VGGCNNF = [3x3, 2].
