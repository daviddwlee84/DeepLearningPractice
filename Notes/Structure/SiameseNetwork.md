# Siamese Networks

## Overview

### Major Application

* Face Recognition based upon Similarity
* Object Classifier
* Detect minute changes in Documents
* Blood Cell Classification

## Concepts

### Contrastive Loss

### Oneshot Learning

> Oneshot learning is like extracting the feature vectors of the input images from the trained model to say **how much both of the images are dissimilar** without training the images of large datasets

### Few Shot Learning
